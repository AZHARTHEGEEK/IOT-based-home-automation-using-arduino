# Home Automation
(Using Nodemcu)Working on Sustainable Development Goal 4 & 11
Objective
Technology is rapidly evolving with the passage of time. People and daily life routines rely heavily on the internet. While the cost of living continues to rise, there is a rising emphasis on using technology to reduce those costs. With this in mind, the Smart Home project enables the user to construct and manage a home that is smart enough to conserve energy while also delivering more automated applications. A smart house will make use of its environment and provide smooth management whether the user is there or not.  With this benefit, we can be confident that our home is working optimally in terms of energy efficiency. The world's current challenge is to create smart homes and efficient energy systems (SDG goal 4 & 11)
Home is where the comfort is. The real comfort lies in living smart & simple
